display_name: Get Entities by Type Name
short_description: Get all entities of a specific exact type from the knowledge graph
arguments:
  - name: type_name
    type: str
    description: Exact type name of entities to retrieve (e.g., "schema:Person", "Vehicle", "schema:Integration")
    required: true
  - name: max_results
    type: int
    description: Maximum number of entities to return
    required: false
    default: 50
returns: List of all entities matching the exact type with their properties
use_cases:
  - Getting all "schema:Person" entities (all people)
  - Retrieving all "Vehicle" entities
  - Listing all "schema:Integration" entities
  - Extracting all "Organization" entities
  - When you know the exact schema type name
notes:
  - Requires exact type name (e.g., "schema:Person" not "person")
  - Use extract_entities_by_type for natural language queries
  - Includes literals (properties) for each entity
  - More efficient when exact type name is known
