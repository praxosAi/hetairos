display_name: Consult User Capability Documentation
short_description: Searches the internal knowledge base to understand HOW to perform tasks for the user and what capabilities exist.

detailed_description: |
  Allows the agent to search its own user manual to understand its capabilities, 
  supported workflows, and how to chain different tools together (e.g., triggers, automations).
  
  Use this when:
  1. The user asks "What can you do?" or "Can you do X?"
  2. You need to know which integrations are required for a specific task.
  3. You are unsure how to construct a complex chain (e.g., "If email then Trello").
  4. You need to explain a feature or workflow to the user.

arguments:
  - name: query
    type: str
    description: The search query (e.g., "how to set up email triggers", "scheduling meetings", "what integrations do I need for Trello").
    required: true

returns: A string containing relevant sections of the user documentation matching the query.

examples:
  - 'consult_documentation("how to create a trigger for emails")'
  - 'consult_documentation("supported file formats for saving to drive")'
  - 'consult_documentation("how to schedule a meeting")'

use_cases:
  - When the user asks general capability questions.
  - When the agent needs to verify if a workflow is supported.
  - To discover prerequisites (integrations) for a task.

notes:
  - The documentation covers user-facing capabilities, NOT code implementation.
  - It explains "how to use" features, not "how they are built".
