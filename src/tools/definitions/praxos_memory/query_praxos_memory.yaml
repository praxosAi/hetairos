display_name: Query Praxos Memory
short_description: Queries the Praxos knowledge base to retrieve context and information about past conversations and user preferences
arguments:
  - name: query
    type: str
    description: Search query for the knowledge base. Make the query rich and detailed for better results.
    required: true
  - name: top_k
    type: int
    description: Number of results to return
    required: false
    default: 4
  - name: exclude_seen_node_ids
    type: list
    description: Optional list of node IDs to exclude from results (useful for iterative searches)
    required: false
    default: null
returns: List of relevant memory nodes with context from past conversations and stored knowledge
use_cases:
  - Questions about past interactions with the user
  - Retrieving user preferences and stored information
  - Finding context from previous conversations
  - Initial step when gathering information about the user
notes:
  - Make queries rich and detailed - short queries are unlikely to get good results
  - Use exclude_seen_node_ids for iterative searches to avoid duplicate results
  - This is often a good first step but don't use blindly if more info is not necessary
  - Uses node_vec search modality for fast vector-based retrieval
