display_name: "Pattern: RAG (Search -> Retrieve -> Process)"
short_description: The standard pipeline for finding and using information from uploaded files or past memories.
detailed_description: |
  This pattern involves three distinct steps to answer a question based on user data:
  
  1. Discovery: Search for the relevant file or fact using 'search_uploaded_files' or 'query_praxos_memory'. This gives you a 'source_id'.
  2. Retrieval: Use 'retrieve_file_by_source_id' to download the content and load it into your active conversation history.
  3. Processing: Synthesize the now-visible content to answer the user's specific request.

use_cases:
  - "Summarize the contract I uploaded."
  - "What did we discuss about the budget in our last meeting?"
  - "Find the date in that PDF receipt."

examples:
  - 'Step 1: search_uploaded_files("contract") -> Step 2: retrieve_file_by_source_id("src_123") -> Step 3: Summarize.'
