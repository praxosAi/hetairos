display_name: Query Praxos Memory (Intelligent Search)
short_description: Queries the Praxos knowledge base with computationally expensive intelligent search for complex queries
arguments:
  - name: query
    type: str
    description: Search query for the knowledge base
    required: true
  - name: top_k
    type: int
    description: Number of results to return
    required: false
    default: 10
returns: List of relevant memory nodes with context from past conversations and stored knowledge
use_cases:
  - When normal search does not yield good results
  - Complex queries requiring deeper understanding of context
  - Second step after normal search fails to find relevant information
  - Queries requiring semantic understanding beyond simple vector matching
notes:
  - Much more computationally expensive than normal search
  - Use only when normal search is insufficient
  - Often a good second step if normal search doesn't yield results
  - Uses intelligent search modality for deeper semantic understanding
