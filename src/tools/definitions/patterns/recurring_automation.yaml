display_name: "Pattern: Recurring Automation (Cron)"
short_description: How to set up tasks that repeat on a schedule (Daily, Weekly, Monthly).
detailed_description: |
  This pattern explains how to handle user requests for repetitive actions.
  
  ## The Logic
  The system supports "Cron-style" scheduling via the `create_recurring_future_task` tool or the `setup_new_trigger` tool (for time-based triggers).
  
  ## When to use which?
  1. **create_recurring_future_task:** Best for simple prompts/reminders to the user.
     - "Remind me to take meds every day."
     - "Ask me about my goals every Friday."
  2. **setup_new_trigger:** Best for executing TOOLS repeatedly.
     - "Every morning at 8am, run the 'Daily Briefing' pattern."
     - "Every Friday at 5pm, scan my Trello for overdue cards."

use_cases:
  - "Remind me to drink water every hour."
  - "Send a status report every Friday."
  - "Check for new emails every 30 minutes."

examples:
  - 'setup_new_trigger("Every day at 9am, check my calendar and message me.")'
