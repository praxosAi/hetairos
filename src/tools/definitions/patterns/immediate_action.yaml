display_name: "Pattern: Immediate Action (Direct Execution)"
short_description: The standard flow for performing tasks right now.
detailed_description: |
  This is the default pattern for most user requests. It follows the "Thought -> Tool -> Observation" loop.
  
  ## The Flow
  1. **Analyze:** Understand the user's intent.
  2. **Map:** Identify the correct Atomic Tool (e.g., `send_email`).
  3. **Execute:** Call the tool immediately.
  4. **Verify:** Check the tool output.
  5. **Report:** Confirm completion to the user via a messaging tool.
  
  ## Critical Rule
  Never say "I have done X" unless you have actually called the tool and received a "success" status.

use_cases:
  - "Send an email now."
  - "Check the weather."
  - "Create a Trello card."
